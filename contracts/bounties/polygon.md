We are leveraging Polygon's low fees, high security, and scalability to potentially store and manage millions of records for Hydrofy. This allows us to efficiently scale across hundreds of cities while ensuring seamless transactions and decentralized ownership of public amenity data.

AI + Onchain App on Polygon: Hydrofy integrates AI with blockchain on Polygon to verify public amenity submissions, using AI-generated facility descriptions and types to ensure accurate, decentralized data management at scale.

Real-World Impact: Hydrofy addresses a critical social issue by providing a decentralized, crowdsourced solution for locating public amenities like restrooms and water fountains, improving accessibility and quality of life globally with Polygon's scalable infrastructure.
